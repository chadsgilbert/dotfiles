README
======

These are basic configuration files (dotfiles) used by me on my Ubuntu 18.04
machine to keep my command line and vim running how I like.

Run `linkdots.sh` to put these dotfiles into your home directory. It will
symlink them to here, so any further changes to the repository will be applied
automatically. Beware, this will delete your current dotfiles!
